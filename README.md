# Adv.-Data-Structure-project

For this project, I hope to create a visual representation of the Fibonacci Heap data structure. This design is on a fixed data set [0,2,5,4] and is not designed for dynamic creation of heaps. A dynamic creation of the visual aid for the heap structure 

To initialize the heap instance simply make a call such as fib = Heap()

for the insert operation...
